○ Please make sure to get an extensive list of feature space, think through
structural other external factors.
    
○ Feature Importance. Dynamic Time Warping and/or XGBoost/Shapley Value
hybrid model approach to quantify which factors influence the target positively or
negative

  ■ Keep the analysis focused on the feature selection and feature
importance aspects

○ LSTM derivatives on day ahead prediction with confidence bounds

● How would you improve and present your results with more time
and resources
